# Development Environment Configuration
# Used when running: npm run dev

# Use /api to leverage Vite's proxy (see vite.config.js)
# The proxy forwards /api requests to https://localhost:5001
VITE_API_URL='https://localhost:5001'

# To bypass proxy and call backend directly:
# VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:5001/api

# To test against deployed backend during development:
# VITE_API_URL=https://casecapi.dink1.com/api
